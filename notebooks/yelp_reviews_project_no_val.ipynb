       "array(['The ratings are not a lie and I have a new Top 3 favourite spot in Toronto. There\\'s a lot of great things about Richmond Station.. but if there is one takeaway from my review, let it be this.  If you want a phenomenal meal, ask specifically for the chef pass and the chef tasting menu.  Not only is it a feast for your taste buds and eyes... it is a feast of all senses.  \\n\\nFrom the outside, you wouldnt think automatically a restaurant of this calibre and space would be hiding behind a simple window golden font of Richmond Station and a tiny signage with  simple words of \\'Restaurant\\'.  If you peered in, you\\'d see an overflowing amount of people enjoying a lot of interesting dishes.  You\\'ll also notice a lot of people coming in to only be sadly turned away.  \\n\\nThe space is warm and welcoming... there\\'s no pretentious airs here.  It\\'s quite different from my other 2 favourite higher end spots (Buca and Grey Gardens).  The atmosphere here is relaxed and if anything, more casual ... though do not mistaken this for a bar atmosphere.  It\\'s still refined with its wood accents and clean lines but the staff creates more of an approachable vibe.  You can see the humour in the hallway to the bathrooms where they have snapshots and commentary of the restaurant.  One of the chefs has a Calgary Flames hat ... the snap of him has \"Get him a leafs hat\".  I will say the tables are kinda close... we heard other table\\'s conversation more than a few times.  \\n\\nBefore I go into the food... I do have to say that Richmond station is possibly my 3rd favourite only because of the kitchen pacing.  For us, our first two dishes were the oysters and charcuterie.  Though they were good... it was 50 minutes after being seated that we got our charcuterie.  If the pacing was better, this would have been my top favourite. \\n\\nWith the chef menu at $65, it does seem a bit pricey but let me tell you that you will feast and be blown away by what you\\'re given.  We were offered a total of 7 dishes with a final offering of petit four ... so 8 dishes really.  So if you\\'re concerned you will be not getting any value... put those fears aside & just enjoy the show.\\n\\nChef Menu \\n\\nOysters on the half shell - Briney & bright with minimal metallic flavour ... the addition of the horseradish & lemons makes this starter pop.  The oysters were a generous size (not too big) and perfectly opened... not a speck of shell or sand.  You\\'re treated to 2 oysters each.  4.5/5\\n\\nIn house made Charcuterie - If someone says no to this beauty of a platter, I dont think we can be friends.  With 5 types of offerings & a side of pickled vegetables & bold savoury mustards, this was just a great way to perk my taste buds more.  The pickled beats was a perfect pairing to the fatty rich meat.  I wish I could have had more.  The bacalhau (spelling... salted cod really) was just so tender after breaking through the greaseless crispy shell.   5/5\\n\\nBrassica Caesar - This is an interesting take on a Caesar salad.  Instead of the mayo bland romaine lettuce, they used broccoli, cauliflower, shredded cabbage, roasted sprouts, with a health dose of roasted nuts (love their crunch and smokiness), parmigana, and yes... anchovies.  BUT these anchovies are tender savoury bursts ... it\\'s good.  Trust the chef.  I love the take on this classic.  4.5/5\\n\\nRoasted Cod - OH YES... definitely a perfectly cooked and seared fish.  The perfect crispy sear gave way to a tender white fish.  Seasoned so well...it still tasted of sweet fresh fish.  I liked this a lot but what was also great was the bold pairing of the red pepper rouille that sat on top of the sourdough bread.  I think I lost my piece of red pepper bread to a hungrier cub cause it was that good. 5/5\\n\\nSirloin - I learned they dry age these in house... up to 6 weeks and you can honestly taste the nuances.  This was very savoury with the perfect sear.  It\\'s just so ... meaty and beefy in flavour but so tender in texture.  I wouldnt say it\\'s spongey soft like a tenderloin but this might be one of the better sirloins I\\'ve eaten.  The bloodthirsty carnivore in me loved every bite.  5/5\\n\\nStation Burger - Oh hell yes... It has been more than 4 years since I\\'ve eaten a burger and wow, what a bite to break that up.  Damn.  Ok, I get why this has been on the menu since the start.  It\\'s cooked to a juicy medium rare and served with a lot of great flavours.  You have the soft milk bun ready to sop up all the juices, bold acidity of the beet chutney and pickles that cut through the beef, the mild sweetness of beets, aged cheddar for a bite, and aioli for the lucious texture. 5/5\\n\\nCreamsicle - Deconstructured with many components.  It\\'s more subtle orange flavours paired with licorice flavoured fennel and graham.  Orange white chocolate mousse, grand marnier creme, fennel sherbert, and graham cracker soil is all great when put on one spoon.  4.5/5\\n\\nPetit Four - Dense dark fudge, bright & tart cranberry gelee, earl grey macaron, meringue.  Nice presentation. 4/5',\n",
       "       \"REVIEW # 10\\n\\nI found out about Pink Jeep as I was researching tours for the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon was the first thing on my to-do list once I went to Arizona. I knew nothing about the Grand Canyon other than its huge, has beautiful views and a tour guide is the best choice if you want to get the most of your view and days' worth.\\nTwo months before I booked with Pink Jeep. I was back and forth with this company and many other jeep tour companies but after speaking to Margie, a wonderful woman with tons of patience she went over everything that the tour offered and the breakdown of the day. \\nI went ahead and booked the tour which was $135 with taxed turned out to be $170. The price included a 13 hour tour. Pick up at 6:30AM with a drop off at around 8 or 9PM. Here are the details about the tour:\\n\\nPICK UP TIME:\\nPick up time was smooth. I had the pleasure of being picked up by a nice gentleman named Dan. I knew exactly that it was my car when they pulled up because of the big bus which was totally noticeable from a mile away. Once we got in Dan notified me that it would be only 1 more passenger that day so it was a small group and I am SO happy it was, it made the experience THAT much better! We picked up the next young lady traveler and then we were on our way to Sedona!\\n\\nTHE DRIVE:\\nWas smooth! Dan spoke to me and the young lady the whole way giving us history on what we were looking at/the views as well as the history of Arizona itself! It was amazing! On the ride, I also learned that the cactuses that are in Arizona are about 100-200 years old and you can get a fine for hurting them! Can you believe that? Well believe it, because my tour guide Dan told me that and that man was so dang knowledgeable! I could hear him talk all day and wouldn't get tired!\\n\\nTHE BUS:\\nWas fancy! I mean FANCY! The seats are really comfortable and sit a great amount of passengers. The seats recline so you can move it to fit your preference. I was so happy I was able to charge my phone on the bus as the bus is equipped with plugs! Big A+! There is AC on the bus and they also provide snacks and drinks so in case you forget no worries! Pink Jeeps has you covered!\\n\\nMY TOUR GUIDE:\\nMy tour guide was absolutely phenomenal! Dan the man totally exceeded my expectations! From the time he picked me up to the time he dropped me off I was totally impressed with his Hospitality and customer service. When we made our way to Sedona I was in awe with the views and Dan was even nice enough to be my photographer for the whole day! After Sedona we got back in the bus and took a nice drive to the headquarters of Pink Jeep and spent a couple hours exploring that area and picking up our lunches, taking a lunch break and doing some shopping.  \\nTHE SOUTH RIM GRAND CANYON:\\nOkay, so let me be honest and say this was my BEST part of my trip! I had a great time and I give all the praise to Dan! Once we made it to the Grand Canyon Dan gave me the run down on where to start and where he would pick me up! Let me tell you that the Grand Canyon is HUGEE!! Dan gave us about 2-3 hours to explore the canyon on our own and gave us his number so we could call him if we needed him for anything! I started at the beginning point and took TONS of pictures!! I seemed to walk about 2miles and seen views that are indescribable; I mean pictures are not even good enough to explain! I ran into great people from all different types of the world and even seen some performances which were amazing! As I walked around I took amazing pictures of me by the rim and as I thought I reached the end I called Dan to come pick me up and once he told me that I still had an hour to go I felt like a whole day at the Grand Canyon was not enough at all!\\nDan came and picked me up where I was standing and took me around to meet our other young lady that took the tour with us. We got out the bus and Dan gave both of us so incredible tours of the canyon and really had us come out of our comfort zone! I am nerves of heights and Dan was able to have me trust him (just a little bit) so I could take incredible pictures of me sitting on the rim of Grand Canyon! If you are given the chance to step out of your comfort zone please take the risk because you will not regret it! The views are amazing and the pictures that Dan took of me had people thinking I was climbing the Grand Canyon! It was so cool!! I wish there was an option to spend a night with the Pink Jeep and wake up and tour more of the canyon!\\nOverall, I can take pictures and have you seen how amazing the Grand Canyon is but the pictures will not do any justice! You have to go visit this place as well as take Pink Jeep tour to make sure you get the big buck for your money! I was thinking about doing this tour without a guide and I personally do not think I would have been able to see everything that I did if I was to do it solo. Pink Jeep tours totally exceeded my expectations and I thank Dan for being the amazing tour guide! \\nREVIEW 133/196\"],\n",
